      The Oakland Khmer Angkor Dance Troupe was established in 1996 with the mission of preserving Cambodian culture through the art of dance. Building unity and strengthening the Khmer community in the Greater Bay Area, our troupe celebrates cultural dances, traditional food, clothing, and music. Our performances have captivated local audiences, sharing the beauty and elegance of our heritage and ensuring that every member, especially the younger generation, has a chance to succeed in all facets of life.
      <br /><br />
      Originally organized by a dedicated group of volunteers, with strong support from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints' Oakland 10th Cambodian Branch, our program serves more than 60 participants annually, ages 6 to 72. These dancers are taught a range of Cambodian folkloric and classical dances and are provided with costumes and accessories. Our weekly practices, running from January to March, focus on skill-building and community, with refreshments offered to keep our participants energized. Each March, in partnership with other Khmer dance communities, we host a vibrant Cambodian New Year celebration in Oakland, drawing over 1,200 attendees from throughout California.<br /><br />
      This event is a vibrant showcase of cultural performances, games, and social dancing, creating a memorable experience that brings together people from all walks of life to celebrate and preserve our rich cultural heritage.
