      The Oakland Khmer Angkor Dance Troupe was established in 1996 with the mission of preserving Cambodian culture through the art of dance. Building unity and strengthening the Khmer community in the Greater Bay Area, our troupe celebrates cultural dances, traditional food, clothing, and music. Our performances have captivated local audiences, sharing the beauty and elegance of our heritage and ensuring that every member, especially the younger generation, has a chance to succeed in all facets of life.
      <br /><br />
      Led by a dedicated team of community volunteers and supported by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Oakland 10th Cambodian Branch, our program enrolls 50-60 participants annually, ranging in age from 6 to 24. These young dancers are taught a variety of Cambodian folkloric and classical dances and provided with costumes and accessories. Our weekly practices, held from January to March, are a time for learning and community, with refreshments provided to sustain our young participants. Each March, in collaboration with four other Khmer communities, we host a spectacular Cambodian New Year celebration, drawing over 1,200 attendees from across California to Oakland.
      <br /><br />
      This event is a vibrant showcase of cultural performances, games, and social dancing, creating a memorable experience that brings together people from all walks of life to celebrate and preserve our rich cultural heritage.
