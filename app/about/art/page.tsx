      Khmer art, a treasure of Southeast Asia, embodies the rich cultural and historical heritage of Cambodia, dating back to the Angkor era and earlier. Renowned for its intricate stone carvings, serene sandstone sculptures, and detailed bas-reliefs, Khmer art portrays a sophisticated understanding of aesthetics and spirituality. The art forms range from majestic temple architectures, like the world-famous Angkor Wat, to delicate silk weavings and vibrant paintings that depict scenes from mythology and daily Cambodian life.
