      The Oakland Khmer Angkor Dance Troupe is dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich cultural heritage of Cambodian traditional dance. Through education, performance, and community engagement, we aim to inspire and empower youth, foster cross-cultural understanding, and celebrate the beauty of Khmer arts.
      <br /><br />
      We support the artistic growth of our members by providing opportunities for creative expression and collaboration. Through our programs, dancers can explore their artistic potential, develop new choreography, and participate in innovative projects that blend traditional and contemporary elements.
      <br /><br />
      Our work is grounded in the mission to preserve the rich traditions of Khmer dance for future generations. We maintain a comprehensive archive of dance forms, costumes, music, and historical materials, ensuring that this invaluable cultural heritage remains vibrant and accessible.
